# Maze Solver
### Overview
This project is a Java-based maze-solving application with both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The maze is represented graphically using the Swing framework, and users can generate random mazes, solve them, or clear and reset the maze. The application features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the maze.

### Features
- DFS & BFS Solvers: Solve the maze using either DFS (stack-based) or BFS (queue-based) methods.
- Random Maze Generation: Generate random mazes with different configurations.
- Maze Visualization: The maze is displayed with different colors representing walls, free paths, the start, and the goal.
- Elapsed Time Tracking: Displays the time taken by each algorithm to solve the maze.
- Reset & Exit: Options to clear the maze and exit the application.
